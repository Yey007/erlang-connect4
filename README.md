# erlang-connect4

An Erlang escript for a basic terminal-based Connect4 game. I'm very new to Erlang, so please feel free to offer advice on how to write better code.

## Build

    $ rebar3 escriptize

## Run

If you've already compiled the project, you can just run the executable.

    $ _build/default/bin/connect4

Otherwise, you can use `run.sh` to build and run the project.

    $ ./run.sh
